# Potential solution #1 - manual input manipulation
# - Generate as many tags as reasonable up front (hair color, eye color, pose, clothes, scenery, additional tags like detailed or drawn by ________, from above/below/side or dutch angle, etc), then take the Seed ID (I forget the exact term cause I don't make images anymore), make sure thats the same from generation to generation, and then change tags here and there to get the individual to do/look differently. 
#   - start by generating tags for the overal style of the illustrations, each setting in the story, and for each charachter in the story - then make sure the appropriate tags are used for each pages illustration + whatever the action on the page is
#       - what about poses, positions, scenarios?
